# E-Commerce System Implementation Plan (Detailed Workflow)

This document provides a detailed explanation of the e-commerce system implementation plan, including step-by-step workflows for each component, data flow, validation, and processing.

---

## 1. User Management

### User Registration and Login

#### User Registration
1. A new user provides details like `name`, `email`, `password`, `billing_address`, and `shipping_address`.
2. The system validates the email format and ensures the email is not already registered.
3. The password is hashed and stored securely.
4. A `User` object is created with a unique `user_id` and stored in the database.

#### User Login
1. The user provides their `email` and `password`.
2. The system verifies the email exists and matches the hashed password.
3. On successful login, a session is created, and the user is redirected to their dashboard.

---

### Customer Actions

#### Update Profile
1. The customer provides updated details (e.g., new name, email, or address).
2. The system validates the new email format and ensures it’s not already in use.
3. The `User` object is updated with the new details.

#### View Purchase History
1. The system retrieves all orders associated with the customer’s `user_id` from the `Order` class.
2. The orders are displayed in a structured format, including `order_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`, and `status`.

#### Add to Cart
1. The customer selects a product and specifies the quantity.
2. The system checks if the product is in stock using the `InventoryManager`.
3. If available, the product and quantity are added to the `ShoppingCart`.

#### Place Order
1. The customer proceeds to checkout from the `ShoppingCart`.
2. The system creates an `Order` object with the cart items, calculates the `total_amount`, and sets the status to "Pending".
3. The `InventoryManager` updates the stock levels for each product in the order.

---

### Admin Actions

#### Add Product
1. The admin provides product details (e.g., `name`, `category`, `price`, `stock_quantity`).
2. The system validates the details (e.g., price must be positive, stock must be non-negative).
3. A new `Product` object is created and added to the `ProductCatalog`.

#### Remove Product
1. The admin specifies the `product_id` to remove.
2. The system checks if the product exists and is not part of any active orders.
3. The product is removed from the `ProductCatalog`.

#### Manage Inventory
1. The admin provides the `product_id` and the new stock quantity.
2. The system updates the `stock_quantity` in the `Product` object and triggers a low-stock alert if necessary.

---

## 2. Product Catalog

### Product Management

#### Add Product
1. The admin provides product details, including `name`, `category`, `price`, and `stock_quantity`.
2. The system validates the details and creates a `Product` object.
3. The product is added to the appropriate `ProductCategory`.

#### Update Product Stock
1. The admin provides the `product_id` and the new stock quantity.
2. The system updates the `stock_quantity` in the `Product` object.
3. If the stock falls below a threshold, a low-stock alert is triggered.

#### View Product Details
1. The customer or admin requests details for a specific product using the `product_id`.
2. The system retrieves the product details from the `Product` object and displays them.

---

## 3. Shopping Cart and Order Processing

### Shopping Cart

#### Add Product to Cart
1. The customer selects a product and specifies the quantity.
2. The system checks if the product is in stock using the `InventoryManager`.
3. If available, the product and quantity are added to the `ShoppingCart`.

#### Remove Product from Cart
1. The customer selects a product to remove from the cart.
2. The system removes the product from the `ShoppingCart` and updates the `total_price`.

#### Apply Discount
1. The customer provides a discount code.
2. The system validates the discount code and applies it to the `total_price`.

#### Checkout
1. The customer proceeds to checkout.
2. The system creates an `Order` object with the cart items, calculates the `total_amount`, and sets the status to "Pending".
3. The `PaymentProcessor` processes the payment.

---

### Order Processing

#### Generate Invoice
1. The system retrieves the order details (e.g., `order_id`, `customer`, `order_items`, `total_amount`).
2. The invoice is formatted and returned to the customer.

#### Update Order Status
1. The admin updates the order status (e.g., "Shipped", "Delivered").
2. The system updates the `status` attribute in the `Order` object.

---

## 4. Inventory Management

### Track Stock

#### Check Stock Levels
1. The system retrieves the current stock levels for all products from the `InventoryManager`.
2. Low-stock alerts are triggered for products below the threshold.

#### Restock Product
1. The admin provides the `product_id` and the quantity to restock.
2. The system updates the `stock_quantity` in the `Product` object.

---

## 5. Payment Processing

### Process Payment

#### Validate Payment Details
1. The system validates the payment details (e.g., card number, expiry date, CVV).
2. If valid, the payment is processed through a simulated payment gateway.

#### Update Order Status
1. If the payment is successful, the order status is updated to "Completed".
2. If the payment fails, the order status remains "Pending".

#### Refund Payment
1. The admin initiates a refund for a specific order.
2. The system validates the order status and processes the refund through the payment gateway.

## 6. System Flow

1. **Customer Flow:**
   - Register/Login → Browse Products → Add to Cart → Checkout → View Order History.

2. **Admin Flow:**
   - Add/Remove Products → Manage Inventory → Update Order Status → Process Refunds.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - User data flows between `User`, `Customer`, and `Admin` classes.
   - Product data flows between `ProductCatalog`, `ShoppingCart`, and `Order` classes.
   - Payment data flows through the `PaymentProcessor`.

---

## 7. Tracking and Logging

1. **Order Tracking:**
   - The `Order` class maintains a history of all orders, including `order_id`, `customer`, `order_items`, `total_amount`, and `status`.

2. **Inventory Tracking:**
   - The `InventoryManager` tracks stock levels and triggers alerts for low stock.

3. **Payment Logging:**
   - The `PaymentProcessor` logs all transactions, including `transaction_id`, `order_id`, `amount`, and `status`.

## 8. Conclusion

This detailed workflow ensures a robust and scalable e-commerce system. Each component is designed to handle specific responsibilities, with clear data flow and interaction between classes and methods. The system is modular, making it easy to extend or modify in the future.
